## Background {.section-divider}


---

### What is hospice?

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}

## National Cancer Institute Definition
"A program that gives special care to people who are near the end of life and have **stopped treatment to cure or control their disease**...The main goal of hospice care is to **control pain and other symptoms of illness** so patients can be as comfortable and alert as possible. It is **usually given at home**, but may also be given in a hospice center, hospital, or nursing home." *emphasis added*

### Growth of for-profit hospices

### Malleable admission criteria

- Eligibility: Life expectancy < 6 months
- Over 20% live beyond 6 months
- Nearly 30% among FP hospice
- Half of ADRD hospice patients live beyond 6 months

### Summary

1. Big increase in hospice spending
2. Substantial growth of for-profit hospices
3. Potential exploitation of imprecise admission criteria


---

### Research Question

What does growth of FP hospices mean for total health care spending and health outcomes? Do policies intended to curb improper admissions actually work?


---

### Basic idea


- FP hospice appears more aggressive in admitting patients
- Not necessarily "bad" given health status of patients and potential cost savings
- **Policy Implication:** Attempts to curb more aggressive hospice admissions may have unintended consequences


---

## What does this paper do? {.section-divider}


---

### Empirical strategy

- Focus on ADRD diagnosis without restriction to people that die within certain time period
- Examine spending and mortality over 5-year period
- 2SLS using FP distance as instrument


:::{.fragment}

$$
\begin{align*}
 FP_{icz} &= \alpha + \beta \mathbf{D_{FP,cz}} + \delta X_{icz} + \gamma D_{NP,cz} + \lambda_{z} + \lambda_{c} + \epsilon_{icz} \\
 Y_{icz} &= \tilde{\alpha} + \tilde{\beta} \widehat{FP}_{icz} + \tilde{\delta} X_{icz} + \tilde{\gamma} D_{NP,cz} + \tilde{\lambda}_{z} + \tilde{\lambda}_{c} + \varepsilon_{icz}
\end{align*}
$$

---

### Empirical strategy

- Identification from variation in spending for different patients within same zip code
- "Pre-period" patients were in the same zip code but FP hospice was further away
- Decomposition of MFX between "otherwise NFP" and "new" hospice patients

---

### Findings

:::{.fragment}
1. Large spending reduction:
   - $44,000 relative to no hospice, small and insignificant relative to NFP
:::

:::{.fragment}
2. Increased mortality:
   - 30% (4 percentage points) 90 days from diagnosis
   - 25% (6.8 percentage points) 1 year from diagnosis
   - 13% (8.6 percentage points) 5 years from diagnosis
   - Larger effects relative to no hospice, null effects relative to NFP
:::

---

## Some conceptual questions {.section-divider}

---

- Hospice will almost always reduce costs, particularly over several year window
- Critical question is where new patients are coming from and how


---

### New FP patients come from:


::: {.incremental}
1. Patients otherwise going to NFP hospice
2. Unmet need due to capacity constraints
3. Unmet need due to information problems
4. Patients not otherwise seeking hospice (induced to hospice)
:::

---

### Who are these new patients?

::: {.incremental}
- If NFP are capacity constrained, FP hospice can draw from potential hospice pool who wouldn't have had access
- If patients misled about curative options, FP hospice can solve information problem
- If not, FP draws from people who would never otherwise have gone to hospice
- Does mortality increase consist of some people otherwise benefiting from curative treatment?

### Diagnosis for hospice

Not only **admission** that is potentially influenced by presence of FP hospice


---

### Diagnosis for hospice


> This was especially pronounced following the announcement of a change in hospice coding guidelines in 2013, which prohibited the use of debility as a primary diagnosis. However, we did not observe a decline in the number of patients enrolled in hospice care after the change, which suggests that patients who would have received hospice care with a debility diagnosis were receiving hospice care with a different primary diagnosis.

### Diagnosis for hospice

- Can the hospice agency affect diagnosis?
- Seems particularly salient in ADRD, where diagnosis itself is unclear

## Some empirical questions {.section-divider}


---

### Does change of ownership matter?

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
chow.data <- read_tsv('data/input/pos-data-combined.txt') %>%
  left_join(pos.term, by="provider") %>%
  group_by(year, profit_status) %>%
  filter(category=="Hospice", year>=1990, !is.na(profit_status), max_own_change>0) %>% 
  filter(year<min_term | is.na(min_term)) %>%
  summarize(hospice_count=n())

chow.data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=hospice_count, group=profit_status)) + 
  geom_line() + geom_point() + theme_bw() +
  geom_text(data = chow.data %>% filter(year==2012), 
            aes(label = c("For profit", "Government", "Not for profit"),
                x = year -1,
                y = hospice_count-5)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma, breaks=seq(0,200,50)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1990, 2021, 1)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 70, hjust=1)) +
  guides(linetype="none") +
  labs(
    x="Year",
    y="Count of Hospices"
  )
```

---

### Distance as an instrument


- Firms locating somewhat strategically
- Presumably partly due to proximity to patients and competitors
- Are FP hospices just locating in under-served areas, where the only other care option is inpatient care?
- Concern made worse when conditioning on NFP distance


---

### Balance on observables

- Some differences in diagnoses 
  - kidney disease
  - diabetes
  - hyperlipidemia
  - hypertension
- Large racial differences (90.3% white versus 83.6%)
- Urban vs rural?


---

## Final thoughts {.section-divider}


---

### Suggestions

- Consideration of "new" hospice patients
   - Mortality effects seem very large
- Preliminary matched/weighted DD estimates using FP entry as treatment
- Sensitivity to NFP distance in 2SLS estimates

---

### Takeaways

1. Great question with important policy implications
2. Interesting welfare question regarding mortality effects
3. **To policy makers...**
   - If you want to encourage or discourage something specific, tie incentives directly to that specific thing
