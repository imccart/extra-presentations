# Health improvements worldwide

We've made *major* improvements in life expectancy (and many other measures of health) across the world

- Poverty reduction
- Technology development and innovation
- Technology diffusion and adoption
- Access to better services, including health care

# Why? U.S. Healthcare is SO Confusing!

# Fragmented

- different ways to get insurance
- mix of providers, organizational structures, and reliance on referrals
- separate billing (for the most part)

**What does all this complexity mean?**

# 4. Variation in prices

Some variation due to different "prices" for different people

- Negotiation with private insurers (bargaining problem)
- Set payment from Medicare and Medicaid
  - Medicaid managed care (80%)
  - Medicare Advantage (45%)
- Uninsured patients (charge amounts)

# Health care and economics (in general)

Lots of interesting economic issues in health care (not all unique to the U.S.):

--

1. Extremely heterogeneous products
2. Asymmetric information between patients and physicians
3. Unobservable quality (experience good)
4. Unpredictable need (inability to shop in many cases)
5. Distortion of incentives due to insurance
6. Adverse selection (asymmetric information between patients and insurers)

---
# How is the U.S. unique?

These factors exist in other markets and in other countries, but...


--

- Health care is unique in the combination of these issues
- U.S. is unique in the extent of these issues in health care (policy problems)
- We have a market based system but **without sufficient competition**...


---
# Trends in competitiveness
Almost any way you define it, hospital markets are more and more concentrated (less competitive) in recent decades.
- 1990: 65% of MSAs highly concentrated, 23% unconcentrated
- 2006: 77% highly concentrated, 11% unconcentrated

# Types of hospitals involved in mergers

- Ascension-Presence: Largest non-profit system in US adds 10 hospitals to existing 9 hospitals in Chicago
- Fairview-HealthEast: 11 hospital system becomes largest in Twin Cities area
- Hospital corporation of america (HCA) adds 4 hospitals to the 10 existing HCA hospitals in Houston
- Northwestern-Centegra: Forms 10 hospital system in Chicago
- Emory-DeKalb: Forms 10 hospital system in Atlanta
- Jefferson-Einstein: Forms 18 hospital system in Philadelphia area

# Effects of reduced competition
1. Higher prices
2. Lower quality, [2020 NEJM Paper](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1901383)
3. Maybe lower costs (but not passed on to lower prices)<br>


---
# Why?
Historical perception of hospital competition as "wasteful" and assumption that more capacity means more (unnecessary) care:
- Certificate of need laws
- Certificate of public advantage
- Scope of practice laws
- Any willing provider laws
- Site-based payment differentials (encourage vertical integration)


---
# Where do we go frome here?

1. Adopt sensible policies

2. Antitrust enforcement

# Health economics at Emory

Graduate program:
- Economics program focus on health as a subfield of economics
- 20-30% of our graduate students are specifically interested in health

Undergraduate program:
- Significant interest in health policy and pre-med
- Recent launch of joint major in economics and human health

Rollins School
- Strong collaboration with Department of Health Policy and Management

---
# Some success stories
