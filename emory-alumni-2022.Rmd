# 4. Variation in prices

Some variation due to different "prices" for different people

- Negotiation with private insurers (bargaining problem)
- Set payment from Medicare and Medicaid
  - Medicaid managed care (80%)
  - Medicare Advantage (45%)
- Uninsured patients (charge amounts)

# Health care and economics (in general)

Lots of interesting economic issues in health care (not all unique to the U.S.):

--

1. Extremely heterogeneous products
2. Asymmetric information between patients and physicians
3. Unobservable quality (experience good)
4. Unpredictable need (inability to shop in many cases)
5. Distortion of incentives due to insurance
6. Adverse selection (asymmetric information between patients and insurers)

---
# How is the U.S. unique?

These factors exist in other markets and in other countries, but...


--

- Health care is unique in the combination of these issues
- U.S. is unique in the extent of these issues in health care (policy problems)
- We have a market based system but **without much competition**...


---
# Trends in competitiveness
Almost any way you define it, hospital markets are more and more concentrated (less competitive) in recent decades.
- 1990: 65% of MSAs highly concentrated, 23% unconcentrated
- 2006: 77% highly concentrated, 11% unconcentrated

# Effects of reduced competition
1. Higher prices
2. Lower quality, [2020 NEJM Paper](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1901383)
3. Maybe lower costs (but not passed on to lower prices)<br>


---
# Why?
Historical perception of hospital competition as "wasteful" and assumption that more capacity means more (unnecessary) care:
- Certificate of need laws
- Certificate of public advantage
- Scope of practice laws
- Any willing provider laws
- Site-based payment differentials (encourage vertical integration)


---
# Where do we go frome here?

1. Adopt sensible policies

2. Antitrust enforcement
