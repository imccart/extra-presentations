## Background {.section-divider}

---

### Research Question

What happens after construction of a new hospital?

- Utilization at focal hospital versus other hospitals in the market
- Quality changes, clinical and non-clinical

---

### Relevant Literatures

1. Entry and competition in hospital markets
2. Patient preferences for clinical quality versus amenities
3. Non-profit hospitals and incentives for overuse?

---

### 1. Entry and Competition

- **Mid 1960s:** Increasing concern about hospital costs and excess capacity, duplicative services and facilities
- **1964:** New York State enacts the first certificate of need (CON) program
- **1974:** National Health Planning and Resources Development Act requires all states to have CON programs
- **1980:** CON laws in place for all states except Louisiana

::: {.fragment}
CON laws enacted during a time in which hospitals were paid on a cost-plus basis, with little to no incentive to control costs
:::

---

### 1. Entry and Competition

- **1986:** Congress repeals the National Health Planning and Resources Development Act
- **1990s:** Many states repeal or weaken CON laws
- **Today:** 35 states and the District of Columbia still have some form of CON laws, 14 states have CON laws that apply specifically to hospitals

::: {.fragment}
As we continue to grapple with increasing hospital prices, CON laws are often cited as part of the problem as they are specifically designed to restrict competition. Repeal of CON laws and similar supply restrictions will tend to encourage entry. What would be the effect of such a policy change?

### 2. Patient Preferences

- Strong evidence that patients value non-clinical quality
- Construction implies shiny new buildings, private rooms, etc.

---

### 3. Non-profit Hospitals

- Possible to link construction with NFP status?
- Reinvesting profits back into system (as necessary for NFP status) may over-incentivize construction
- Policy implications re NFP status if such construction is "wasteful"
- Potential call for more oversight of tax benefits
