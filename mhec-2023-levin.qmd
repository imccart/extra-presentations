### What is hospice?

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}

## National Cancer Institute Definition
"A program that gives special care to people who are near the end of life and have **stopped treatment to cure or control their disease**...The main goal of hospice care is to **control pain and other symptoms of illness** so patients can be as comfortable and alert as possible. It is **usually given at home**, but may also be given in a hospice center, hospital, or nursing home." *emphasis added*
