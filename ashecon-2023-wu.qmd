## Background {.section-divider}

### Geographic Variation in Health Care Spending

Variation is not **just** in spending across geographic areas...also exists:

- quality of care
- *within* geographic markets


---

### Within-market Variation in Health Care Spending and Quality

### Research Question

Does a physician's training explain some amount of the observed variation in care?



---

## What does this paper do? {.section-divider}


---

### Empirical strategy

- Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR)
- Exploit launch of PARTNER TAVR trials in 22 hospitals in 2007
- "trained" physicians compared to "matched" physicians with same fellowship location but just before PARTNER trial


---

### Empirical strategy

- Compare physicians with and without PARTNER training
- Compare physicians exposed to a trained physician versus not (spillovers)

---

### Findings

:::{.fragment}
1. Trained physicians much more likely to use TAVR
    - 150% more likely to use TAVR when part of PARTNER trial
:::

:::{.fragment}
2. Untrained physicians "around" trained physicians also more likely to use TAVR
    - 12% more TAVR when practicing in the same zip code as a trained physician
:::

---

## Some thoughts {.section-divider}

---

### Minor interpretation question

- Is "1.5 times more likely" the right conclusion?
- Or should it be 1.5 times faster?
- Estimates on volume are much smaller (between 20% and 35%)

---

### Metrics point

- Some growing skepticism with $ln(y + \text{c})$ (Mullahy and Norton, 2023)
- Consider OLS on untransformed outcome, two-part model, or Poisson

---

### TAVR adoption is pretty complicated

- TAVR first approved only for high-risk patients ineligible for SAVR
- Later approved for SAVR-eligible high-risk and eventually intermediate risk
- Hospital infrastructure requirements
- Hospital and physician volume requirements



---

### TAVR adoption is pretty complicated

- Requires hospital commitment and likely direct investment
- Availability depends on physician's prior experience
- Are results a reflection of physician skill/preference or...
    - hospital willingness/ability to invest in TAVR program
    - physician switching costs due to differential volume requirements with prior TAVR experience


---

### Suggestions moving forward

- Incorporate volume and infrastructure requirements when constructing matched pairs
- Want to make sure hospitals are on equal footing

---

### Takeaways

1. How do we explain observed variaton? Great question with clear policy implications
2. Good identification strategy to test role of clinical training
3. Complicated setting but seems doable given data
